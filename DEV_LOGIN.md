# Development Login Credentials and Setup

## Quick Login Test

For development testing, I'm creating a simple login bypass and test credentials.

### Test Credentials (if API is working):
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

### Development Bypass:
- Username: `dev`
- Password: `dev`

This will bypass the API call and create a mock token for testing the application flow.
